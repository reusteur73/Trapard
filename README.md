# The story of Trapard

This bot came to life in 2022 with initially straightforward functionality.

Over time, I dedicated effort to transform it into a personalized bot for my friends and me, primarily centered around music and economy functionalities.

Originally, the bot's code was kept private. However, in December 2023, I made the decision to share the bot with the public, which necessitated a thorough code cleanup. The initial code lacked the use of cogs and resembled a chaotic bot.py file with a whopping 14,000  linesâ€”a genuine mess. Not to mention, the code quality was, at times, truly lamentable; most of the requests used the 'requests' library... I had almost no databases, only JSON files. When I did have a database, I used sqlite3... Anyway, I've learned (and it continues today) a lot by learning the discord.py library.

Occasionally, I find the motivation to enhance and update the bot, and I document these changes and updates here.

## Resources I used
- My Brain (to a modest extent)
- The <a href="https://discord.gg/r3sSKJJ" target="_blank">discord.py</a> server
- The <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">discord.py</a> documentation
- Chat GPT (although I do not recommend it, especially considering it is stuck before the 2.2 update of discord.py)
